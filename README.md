## Important Note

This database will be used for bot needs such as games and others. [Saluran Ditss](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaimJO0E50UaXv9Z1J0L). Building upon this foundation, I have implemented several enhancements and introduced new features that were not present in the original repository. These improvements aim to elevate functionality and provide a more robust and versatile experience.
