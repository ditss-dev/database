## Important Note

The original repository was initially removed by its creator and subsequently taken over by [WhiskeySockets](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaimJO0E50UaXv9Z1J0L). Building upon this foundation, I have implemented several enhancements and introduced new features that were not present in the original repository. These improvements aim to elevate functionality and provide a more robust and versatile experience.

## asuma multi device.

Install in package.json:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "baileys": "github:nstar-y/bail"
}
```
or install in terminal:
```
npm install baileys@github:nstar-y/bail
```

Then import the default function in your code:
```ts 
// type esm
import makeWASocket from 'baileys'
```

```js
// type cjs
const { default: makeWASocket } = require("baileys")
```
